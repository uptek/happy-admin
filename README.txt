Happy Admin simplify your WordPress admin by removing unnecessary clutter and dimming high contrast colors.

== Description ==

Clutters are distracting and high contrast colors will always steal your attention which usually results in lowered productivity. It not only cuts off your flow but can disrupt your overall focus.

Happy Admin, an open-source project solves this issue by removing unnecessary clutter from your dashboard and substitute high contract colors with lower contrast colors, which makes the design uniform and pleasing to the eye.

Happy Admin removes the following things.

* Unnecessary banners or columns, this does not include the important WordPress banners and columns.
* Reduces the contrast of attention stealing navigation items and notification badges.
* Disables admin toolbar if you pass in a certain query string. (Read `remove adminbar` section below)

= How To =

Happy Admin automatically removes all the clutter and dim the high contrast elements, however we do plan on providing a settings page very soon, where you may customize what you see and how your admin panel should look.

= Remove adminbar =

Sometimes you may want to remove the adminbar, it can be because you may want to check the layout or anything that's related to styling. You can do that by passing `?toolbar=off` to the URL and pressing enter. Your URL should look something like this 'https://domain.test/?toolbar=off'.
